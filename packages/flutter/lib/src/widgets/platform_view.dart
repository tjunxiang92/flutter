/// Embeds an Android view in the Widget hierarchy.
///
/// Embedding Android views is an expensive operation and should be avoided when a Flutter
/// equivalent is possible.
///
/// The embedded Android view is painted just like any other Flutter widget and transformations
/// apply to it as well.
///
/// The widget fill all available space, the parent of this object must provide bounded layout
/// constraints.
///
/// The Android view object is created using a [PlatformViewFactory](/javadoc/io/flutter/plugin/platform/PlatformViewFactory.html).
/// Plugins can register platform view factories with [PlatformViewRegistry#registerViewFactory](/javadoc/io/flutter/plugin/platform/PlatformViewRegistry.html#registerViewFactory-java.lang.String-io.flutter.plugin.platform.PlatformViewFactory-).
///
/// Registration is typically done in the plugin's registerWith method, e.g:
///
/// ```java
///   public static void registerWith(Registrar registrar) {
///     registrar.platformViewRegistry().registerViewFactory("webview", new WebViewFactory(registrar.messenger()));
///   }
/// ```
///
/// The Android view's lifetime is the same as the lifetime of the [State] object for this widget.
/// When the [State] is disposed the platform view (and auxiliary resources) are lazily
/// released (some resources are immediately released and some by platform garbage collector).
/// A stateful widget's state is disposed the the widget is removed from the tree or when it is
/// moved within the tree. If the stateful widget has a key and it's only moved relative to its siblings,
/// or it has a [GlobalKey] and it's moved within the tree, it will not be disposed.
